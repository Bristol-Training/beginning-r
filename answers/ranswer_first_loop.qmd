Adding more items to the list makes the loop go around more times

```{r}
my_words <- c("Hello", "R", "Goodbye", "R")

for (word in my_words) {
    cat(word, " ")
}
```


A vector cannot have a mixture of data types, so all elements are converted to strings.

```{r}
#| error: true

my_words <- c("Hello", "R", as.numeric(404), "Goodbye", "R", 42)

for (word in my_words) {
    cat(word, "-", class(word), "\n")
}
```


Looping over an empty list does not print anything

```{r}
my_words <- vector()

for (word in my_words) {
    cat(word, " ")
}
```
