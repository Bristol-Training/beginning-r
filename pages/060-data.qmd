title: Reading data
---


So far, all the code we've run is somewhat static. Variables get assinged a value in the script and very time we run it, the output is always be the same. We will see a lot more of this throughout this workshop, but for now we will introduce one more function that R provides, `read.csv`.

The `print` and `cat` functions are one way of how we get information *out* of our program, and the `read.csv` function is a way of getting data *into* it. The function will open and read a *Comma-Separated Values* (csv) file, parse it, and assign the data to a variable on the left hand side of the `<-`.

We will load a dataset of a study about [gene expression data of 42 ER- and ER+ breast cancer patients]("https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/datasets/GDS3nnn/GDS3716/soft/GDS3716.soft.gz")


```{r}
#| filename: read_csv.r

breast <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bristol-Training/beginning-r/refs/heads/main/data/GDS3716.soft",
            sep="\t",
            skip=99)

print(breast[1:10,1:5])
```

Using the breast cancer dataser, modify `read_csv.R` to print the average expresion of the gene TP53.
