title: Summary
---
Well done for getting this far! We've covered a lot in this course:

- How to set up a R workspace with RStudio
- Using the `cat()` and `print()` functions
- Basic data types (integers, floats, strings, boolean)
- Introduction to data structures
- Conditional branching using `if` statements
- Looping with `for` and `while`
- Reading `csv` files

You're not expected to have committed all of this to memory already, learning any programming language takes more than three hours. It is only by continuing to use R and practise that you will become confident. These notes will remain online so feel free to refer back to them at any time.
